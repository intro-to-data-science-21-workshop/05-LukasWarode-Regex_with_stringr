## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) on November 4, 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

## Statement of contributions

**Anna-Lisa Wirth** prepared the (practical) example for the lecture after the formal introduction and the live coding session.

**Lukas Warode** prepared the presentation slides (using `xaringan`) for the first part of the lecture where the basic concepts of *regex* are explained.

## Session contents

The session will **a)** introduce the audience to the basic concepts of regular expressions (*regex*) and **b)** provide some real-world examples where the usage of *regex* is very useful. In addition, the goal of the session also includes the application of `stringr` functions – combined with *regex* – as one of the crucial packages within the `tidyverse`. 

## Main learning objectives

The aim of this session is to **(1)** familiarize the audience with the basic concepts of *regex* without overwhelming them. Since *regex* enables the user to apply very comprehensive and thus complicated string detection mechanisms that are exceeding the scope of this session, the main learning objectives are **(2)** really about focussing on the fundamentals of using *regex* in the context of string manipulation with `stringr`. In order to demonstrate the power of *regex* – that comes with its application for detailed and complex purposes – **(3)** slightly advanced and real article examples are used to present the audience the potential in different string detection tasks.
